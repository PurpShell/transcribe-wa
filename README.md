# transcribe-wa
This is one of my playground projects which solves a huge issue for me (as I am a known voice message spammer).
Docker (and docker-compose) and more customization options supported soon!
Also the code is to be much more optimized soon. Kinda barebones (programmed & published in under 1h45min)

Documentation soon
